OBX|1|FT|^^|EXAM : DESCRIPTION OB Routine anatomy scan~~CLINICAL HISTORY:  Fetal anatomy~~COMPARISON:  Obstetrical ultrasound reports January 17 and January 30, 2023 which had indicated EDC August 6, 2023~~FINDINGS:  Based on EDD this pregnancy should now be at 20 weeks one day.~~There is a single live intrauterine gestation with measurements as follows:~BPD 44.2 mm, 19 weeks two days~Head circumference 162 mm, 19 weeks~Abdominal circumference 148.1 mm, 20 weeks~Humerus 30.8 mm, 20 weeks one day~Femur length 32 mm, 20 weeks~Mean age by today's ultrasound is 19 weeks five days.~~Estimated fetal weight is 320 g which corresponds to the 32.3 percentile for expected gestational age (Hadlock).~~Fetal heart rate measures 162 beats per minute.~~Fetal intracranial structures, orbits, lenses, nose and lips, profile view of the fetal face, spine in sagittal and transverse plane, chest, abdomen, diaphragm, kidneys, stomach, bladder, four-chamber cardiac view, right and left cardiac outflow tracts, cine crossover vessel view, one arm, both hands, both legs, three-vessel cord and abdominal cord insertion site are seen and are unremarkable.~~Distal fetal spine in coronal plane, three-vessel cardiac view, aortic arch, one arm and both feet and ankles are not well seen.~~Fetal sex has not been requested, but is probably female.~~The amniotic fluid volume is subjectively normal.~~The placenta is anterior/fundal and clear of the internal cervical os by approximately 8 cm.  Placental cord insertion site is approximately 3 cm from placental margin on sagittal images.~~A 4.2 x 3.5 x 3.1 cm lower posterior wall fibroid is noted.~~The cervix measures 5.2 cm in length and is closed.~~IMPRESSION:  Single live intrauterine gestation corresponding to 19 weeks five days, slightly smaller than expected according to the patient's dates.~~Estimated fetal weight corresponds to the 32.3 percentile for expected gestational age (Hadlock).~~No gross abnormality of fetal anatomy is demonstrated.~~However, distal fetal spine in coronal plane, three-vessel cardiac view, aortic arch, one arm and both feet and ankles are not well seen.~~Short-term follow-up ultrasound is recommended for reassessment.~||||||F|||||8140||
